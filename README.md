# Blitz.js Example App

This is an evolving example todo list app built using Blitz.js.

I use it as a sample app in my YouTube videos, which you can check out [here](https://www.youtube.com/c/JacquesBlom).

## Running the app

1. Install the Blitz.js CLI: `npm install -g blitz`.
1. Clone the repo and `cd` into it.
1. Run `yarn install`.
1. Run `blitz prisma migrate dev --preview-feature` to initialise the DB.
1. Finally, run `blitz dev` to run it.
